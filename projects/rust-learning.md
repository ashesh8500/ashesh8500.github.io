# Rust Learning Journey  

My experience learning Rust programming language and building projects.

## Why Rust?

Rust appealed to me for several reasons:

- **Memory Safety**: No garbage collector, no memory leaks
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions and system-level speed  
- **Concurrency**: Fearless concurrency with ownership system
- **Ecosystem**: Growing ecosystem with excellent package manager

## Projects Built

### 1. CLI Tools
- Built several command-line utilities
- Learned about error handling with `Result<T, E>`
- Explored the `clap` crate for argument parsing

### 2. Web Development
- Started with basic HTTP servers using `warp`
- Discovered Dioxus for frontend development
- Built this personal website as a learning project

### 3. Systems Programming
- File I/O operations and error handling
- Working with threads and async programming
- Understanding ownership and borrowing

## Key Concepts Mastered

| Concept | Description | Difficulty |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Ownership | Memory management without GC | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Lifetimes | Reference validity tracking | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Traits | Shared behavior definition | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Pattern Matching | `match` expressions | ⭐⭐ |
| Error Handling | `Result` and `Option` types | ⭐⭐⭐ |

## Resources Used

- **The Rust Book**: Official documentation
- **Rust by Example**: Hands-on learning
- **Rustlings**: Interactive exercises
- **Community**: r/rust, Discord channels

## Future Learning Goals

- [ ] Async programming with Tokio
- [ ] WebAssembly compilation
- [ ] Database integration with Diesel
- [ ] Game development with Bevy
- [ ] Embedded programming

> "Rust is not just a programming language; it's a way of thinking about systems programming that prioritizes safety without sacrificing performance."

The journey continues as I explore more advanced Rust concepts and build increasingly complex projects.
