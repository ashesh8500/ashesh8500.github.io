# Rust Desktop Application

A modern desktop application built with Rust and egui framework.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the power of Rust for desktop application development, combining performance with safety.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Rust ðŸ¦€
- **GUI Framework**: egui
- **Graphics**: eframe
- **Markdown Parsing**: pulldown-cmark

## Key Features

### Performance
- Native performance with minimal memory usage
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Compile-time safety guarantees

### User Interface
- Immediate mode GUI with egui
- Retro macOS-style theming
- Responsive window management

### Content Management
```rust
fn render_markdown(ui: &mut egui::Ui, markdown: &str) {
    let parser = Parser::new(markdown);
    // Custom markdown rendering logic
}
```

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern:
1. **State Management**: Central app state with HashMap-based window tracking
2. **Event Handling**: Immediate mode UI events
3. **Content Rendering**: Custom markdown parser integration

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Enhanced markdown features (tables, links, images)
- [ ] Theme customization system
- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Export functionality

*Built with passion for Rust and desktop application development.*
