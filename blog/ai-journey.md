# My Journey into AI Engineering

Starting my career in artificial intelligence has been an incredible journey of discovery and learning.

## The Beginning

I began with traditional machine learning algorithms:
- Linear regression
- Decision trees  
- Random forests
- Support Vector Machines

## Deep Learning Revolution

The real breakthrough came when I discovered deep learning:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

## Current Focus

Now I'm working on:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Building conversational AI systems
- **Computer Vision**: Developing image recognition models
- **MLOps**: Deploying models at scale
- **Ethical AI**: Ensuring responsible AI development

The future of AI is bright, and I'm excited to be part of this revolution!
